## Issues

Issues are very important to the development of this project. We suggest that
they should be used for:

- Any ideas that you would like to see us look into or include in this project.
- Problems, incorrect information, or lack of information.
- Questions regarding details or information presented.
- Discussions regarding a publication you would like to add to this project.
- Discussions regarding publications you would like removed from this project.
- Or other similar such interactions.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the main way for us to review and include your own
publications. When deciding on whether a certain publication will be included
in this project we will look at the following:

- **Is the publication informative?** We are looking for informative
  publications that don't constitute promotion or advertisement.
- **Is the publication relevant?** We are looking for new contributions to be
  up to date - that's not so say that publications can't reference historical
  details, such as past data breaches for example, but new contributions should
  have some current relevance and usefulness.
- **Is the publication unbiased?** We are looking for publications that don't
  obviously prefer or present bias towards any product, organisation, or
  otherwise such that the publication specifically promotes the subject. This,
  however, doesn't prevent nor restrict the publishing of publications in the
  form of product-specific guides, reports or details regarding events or
  information that may negatively reflect on subject parties (such that the
  details and/or information presented are true and reference other credible
  sources).
- **Is the publication of a good quality?** When reviewing a publication we
  will look at the spelling and grammar of its wording, in addition to looking
  at how it reads and how concise the information is.
- **Is the publication legal to publish?** We will look at the legality of
  publishing the information you provide. This may include, but is not limited
  to: copyright infringement, attribution, and licensing.
- **Is the publication truthful or source-backed?** We will look at whether the
  publication is truthful and backed by adequate credible sources.
